The menu options, accessible in all pages, is detailed below:

# Tools

* Show 2D Maps: Show the [[2D Map|Using the 2D Map]]
* Show 3D Maps: Show the [[3D Map|Using the 3D Map]]

* Set Default Map Colour: [[set the default map colour|Using the Settings Page]], 3D Map section.

* Edit theme: See [[Configuring the look of EDDiscovery|Configuring the look of EDDiscovery]]

* Pop Outs: If you have pop outs you can't find on the screen due to transparency or are configured to not show in the task bar, use this to make them findable.

* Exit: Quit!

# Admin

* Synchronise with EDDB: Force a manual check of EDDB for station data.

* Synchronise with ESDM: Force a manual check of EDSM for star data.

* Show journal files directory of current commander: Open an explorer on the commanders journal files

* Show Elite Dangerous directory: Open an explorer on the elite dangerous folder

* Reset All History to current Commander: **Advanced** All entries in the database will be reset to the current commander. Use with extreme caution. Should only be used if you have one commander pre 2.2 and you want to move those entries to your 2.2 commander with its new name

* Read 2.1 and former log files: **Advanced** Use to read former netlog files (which must have had verbose logging turned on) and import them into the database. Find them in Elite Folder\Products\elite-dangerous-64\Logs

* Rescan all journal files: **Advanced** Force a rescan of all files previously read to ensure all entries are there. Only use if data has been lost in the past.

* Delete duplicate FSD Jump Entries: **Advanced** If an import of 2.1 and former files caused duplicate jump entries, use this to try and solve it

* Send unsysced EDDN events: Use to send EDDN scan events in the past. Good to use if you did not had EDD running at the time for the scan event.

* Clear EDSM ID assigned to all records for current commander: **Advanced** If you are having problems with notes disappearing, or a system is not matching the EDSM entry (which on an individual basis you can fix using a right click on the travel grid and selecting Assign new system), use this. This will clear the association between a entry and an EDSM star.  EDDiscovery will then when next refreshed or run try and find that association again.  If EDSM ever (unlikely) renumbers stars, then also notes could disappear as they are keyed to the EDSM ID.  This would also solve this.
