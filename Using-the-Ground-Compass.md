The ground compass panel calculates the bearing between two sets of coordinates for surface navigation.

Enter your destination in coordinates in the Target Longitude and Target Latitude boxes.

The coordinates of your current position can be entered manually and these will also update automatically when a journal containing them is written by the game.

Events which cause the coordinates to be written to a journal are:
* Starting the game while on a planet surface
* Landing on or taking off from a planetary surface - the current position will only update if these are player controlled, not autopilot
* Taking a screen shot when in orbital flight below the tick height (usually around 20-30km, watch your altimeter on descent for the point where it ticks briefly upwards) or when on the surface.

The bearing is recalculated when either set of coordinates is changed and gives the initial bearing for a straight line to follow for the great circle to your destination - this straight line will change bearing as you move over the surface, potentially quite dramatically, so you should expect your bearing in-game to drift away from the bearing on the compass panel if you hold to a straight course - take a screen shot to quickly update your current position if you want to confirm you are still on track.
