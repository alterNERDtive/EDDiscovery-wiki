The combat panel provides information on bounties and other combat related events between two time periods

The drop down selector allows selection of the time period.  It can either be user entered, or be linked to a mission.

The panel will sum up bounties, kills etc during the period.  If the mission is related to a faction, you will get information on how many of the faction you killed.

In a popped out window, you can set the grid to hide when its selected to be transparent.  That way the panel can be moved on top of the ED window and provide a HUD of the combat.
