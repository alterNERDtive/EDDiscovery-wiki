From EDD 10.1, EDD supports loading a 3rd party DLL.

3rd party DLL will normally be distributed along with a action pack, installed using the [[Add-On menu|Using the manage Add Ons Menu]].  

This [[repository on git|https://github.com/EDDiscovery/EDDiscoveryAdditionalDLLs]] has an example DLL and a harness to demonstrate how to write a 3rd party DLL.
