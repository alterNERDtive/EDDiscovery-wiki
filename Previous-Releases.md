## 5.0 and previous

See the github release history

## Very old notes for posterity:

Release log:

2016-04-13 Release 3.0.5

klightspeed: 3dMaps

Beeing able to show multiple maps on the Y=0 plane, and being able to filter by expedition or by date.
Add support for map textures to 3D map
Order maps by order clicked
Add ability to filter 3DMap visited systems by date
Camera now centers correctly on requested system again.
Improves the performance of the 3D map significantly by using Vertex Buffer Objects. This along with Vsync should give smooth movement using the keyboard.
Reduce the amount of CPU and GPU time being used when no movement is occurring, and stops the map being updated when the map window is not active, as requested in #60. This should also fix #161.

Set active commander when saving netlogs

Iainross;

Prevent error centring 3D map on nonexistent system
Merge remote-tracking branch 'blessed/master'
Prevent error clicking on header row of wanted systems list
Finwen:

Added a custom toolstrip renderer. To make theming of menues and toolsstrip (still some work to do)
Solved some exceptions usesers reported.
Added a button to show all stars on 2D Map.
Probably solved a expeption in 3D graph some users get then using a XBox controller.


2016-04-05 Release 3.0.4

Iainross:

3D Map is now centred properly and references lines drawn correctly when launched from the trilateration tab if default centre is set to Home System.
Added 3D Map button to Route tab, plotted route is drawn onto the map when launched from there.
Added 'Add to trilateration' context menu to Nearest Systems grid on Travel History control.
Added context menu to Distances grid on trilateration to copy systems to wanted systems list - local wanted systems are shown in the wanted systems grid, can be added to the distances grid by clicking and are persisted between sessions.
Added context menu to Wanted Systems grid on trilateration for deletion of locally added Wanted Systems.
Corrected check that systems are known on EDSM so it works again (site has started returning [] rather than -1 for bad system names)
Systems can be added to wanted from travel history

klightspeed: 3DMap updates
This adds the option for perspective rendering as an alternative to the current orthogonal rendering.
This also maps Right-drag to Y-axis translation, and Left+Right-drag to panning on the X and Z axes.
This adds the ability to see what star is at a given position in the 3D map, and to center the map on that star.
A single-click on a star will select the star, but not set it as the center system.
Double-clicking on a star will select the star, set it as the center system, and center the map on it.
It was suggested in #160 that when the centered system is changed, the camera angle should not change. This implements this, and also slews the camera in order to reduce confusion as to where the camera moved to.
This currently uses a sinusoidal velocity curve with a fixed 1 second slew duration regardless of distance or zoom. Clicking the mouse or pressing a movement button cancels the slew.

Finwen:

After 3d map was opened the close button failed to exit EDDiscovery
