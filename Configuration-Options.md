Command Line Options.

These are for advanced users only.  Use at own risk.

These are read from both the EDDiscovery command line and from an options file.  They are case insensitive.

The default options file to read is options.txt in the application install folder of EDDiscovery.  To change this file use -optionsfile <filename> on the command line. If just a file name, it will be searched for in the install folder of EDDiscovery.  If a full path, use the full path location.

Command line options are as follows:

# USER

* -NRW or -NoRepositionWindow : Use default window positions, don't load at previous positions

* -Portable : Store data in same folder as executable.  If you use this, the EDDiscovery folder must be user writable.

# Developer

* -appfolder : Use this folder instead of EDDiscovery in the <users>/appdata/local folder.  This can be used to separate the data bases of different commanders if required.  Not needed for multi commander use.  Mostly its for debug purposes.

* -userdbpath: Use this path for the user data base instead of the default appfolder/EDDUser.sqlite file.

* -systemsdbpath: Use this path for the systems data base instead of the default appfolder/EDDSystem.sqlite file.

* -olddbpath: Use this path for the old ED Discovery data base (pre 2.2) instead of the default appfolder/EDDSystem.sqlite file.

* -Tracelog : Do a tracelog even when debugging.

* -LogExceptions: Log exceptions

* -EDSMBeta: Use EDSM Beta server

* -EDSMNull: Disable EDSM integration

* -DisableBetaCheck: Don't check for beta flag in journals.  Warning this may confuse the history.  Debugging only.
