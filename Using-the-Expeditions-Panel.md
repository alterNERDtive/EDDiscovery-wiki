The expedition panel allows you to create a route through the galaxy, with waypoints, from a defined time and date to an end date.

To use, click on new route.  Enter the name of the route. Select the timescale for the expedition.

Then you can enter systems manually into the System Name Column. As you enter them, it will show the distance between known systems. Systems from the history grid can be exported to this grid by right clicking and then "Add to", "Saved Route".

Right clicking on an entry in the grid allows you copy, paste, insert and remove row entries. Using this you can re-order the route.

You can then show the route on the 3D map.

Delete route allows you to remove routes saved.  Reverse route allows you to retrace your steps.

To retrieve previous saved routes, use the drop down box to select the route to show.

You can import routes from the route panel using the import route button.

You can import systems from a .txt file using Import file.  This file should just be a list of systems with a line feed between each system.
