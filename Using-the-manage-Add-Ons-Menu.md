When run, the menu checks with the ED Discovery database to see if any new or existing action packs or other adds ons are available.

It then lists all the locally installed packs and shows you the version, and if a new pack is available you will see an install option, or if the pack has been updated a update option as below:

You can also delete a local pack (X) and enable or disable a pack (tick box).
