The 3D Map uses the data EDDiscovery downloads from EDSM to show a galaxy map of the known (by commanders) systems. 

Click on 3D Map button on the History page to launch it.

On first run, EDSM data takes a while to download, so the 3DMap will not be available until this is done.  The log window gives you information on the download progress.

The stars build dynamically as you run the 3D Map, so you will see them building up.

Zooming in and out, moving around is performed by the mouse mostly.  Use the mouse wheel to zoom, Left drag to rotate, right to go up/down (dependent on perpective mode), left+right to translate.

Use the menu bar to select many features to turn on/off on the maps:
