The settings page configures operation of EDDiscovery.

The page is split into the following sections.

# Commanders
This grid shows you information on the list of commanders that EDDiscovery has stored information on.

It also allows you to edit the configuration of a commander and add or delete commanders.

See the topic [[How EDDiscovery Works|How EDDiscovery Works]] for information on how EDDiscovery discovers and creates new commanders. You can add a new commander manually, but that is not normally required any longer as EDDiscovery will make a new commander if it sees one in your journal logs.

The only use case for adding a commander manually is if you want to scan non standard folders for journal files. 

You can manually delete a commander. Note if the journal is scanned with the commander again, it will be auto recreated.

Clicking on Edit or Add will take you to the settings screen

Here you can configure:

* Override Journal Location: Used in the remote EDDiscovery use case where you are running EDDiscovery from another computer and looking at the journal files on a file share. EDDiscovery will scan the folder given and read in all journal files found there.

* EDSM Integration: If you want to send your travel history to EDSM, you need to enter your EDSM Commander name, EDSM API key [[EDSM Integration|EDSM Integration with EDDiscovery]], and choose the sync directions you want to use.

* EDDN Integration: Select if you want to send information to the EDDN network (which you probably do if you like using EDDB etc since they rely on our data feeds)

* EGO Integration (TODO: requires updated image): If you want to automatically send discoveries to EGO, you need to enter your EGO login and API key [[EGO Integration|EGO integration with EDDiscovery]], and choose the sync directions you want to use.

* Frontier Companion API: If you wish, give your Frontier account log in details here (which is saved in encrypted form) and EDDiscovery will obtain information from the Frontier servers.  This is used primarly to obtain [[Market Data Panel|Using the Market Data Panel]] and drives that panels information. 

# Options

These configure EDDiscovery:

* Log EDSM requests: Store EDSM requests in a log in your APPDATA EDDiscovery folder.
