The page is split into the following sections.

# Commanders
This grid allows you to configure information for commanders. 

See the topic [[How EDDiscovery Works|How EDDiscovery Works]] for information on how EDDiscovery discovers and creates new commanders.

You can add a new commander manually, but that is not normally required any longer.  The only use case for this is if you want to scan non standard folders for journal files. In which case, make a commander (any name will do) and set the override journal location to the folder where journal files will be written.  Then EDDiscovery will scan that folder and read in all journal files found there, creating commanders as required.  This is useful if your runnin EDDiscovery remotely from ED - share a network drive and EDDiscovery will work.

You can manually delete a commander. Note if the journal is scanned with the commander again, it will be auto recreated.

You may wish to configure a commander, for interaction with other systems as follows:

* EDSM API Key: If your going to send travel history to EDSM, you need to enter your EDSM API key [[EDSM Integration|EDSM Integration with EDDiscovery]].

* EDSM Name: If for some reason you did not use the same commander name used in game on EDSM, enter your EDSM name here.

* Override Journal Location: Used in the remote EDDiscovery use case above.

* Sync To EDSM: Click this on to send travel entries to EDSM.

* Sync From EDSM: Click this to get travel entries from EDSM into your history

* Sync to EDDN: Send selected events to EDDN.  The list of events is Trading data, outfitting, shipyear, stars.
