The Shopping List panel combines the [Engineering](https://github.com/EDDiscovery/EDDiscovery/wiki/Using-the-Engineering-panel) and [Synthesis](https://github.com/EDDiscovery/EDDiscovery/wiki/Using-the-Synthesis-Panel) controls into a single panel.

Set the wanted values on both controls to produce a single shopping list for the required materials needed for the combined synthesis and engineering recipes.

The Engineering and Synthesis grids are hidden when the panel is made transparent allowing the list itself to be used as an overlay to the game.

A context menu (reachable by right-clicking on the shopping list) allows the following options to be set:

* Show Max FSD Injections - if checked the Shopping List panel will always show the maximum of each level of FSD injection available.

* Show Body Materials When Landed - if checked the Shopping List panel will show, when you are on a planet, the available materials and their frequency for the body where you are.

* Include Material %age on Landed Body in Shopping List - if checked the Shopping List will highlight, when landed, the frequency of any materials in the list which are available on the body where you are.

* Show System Availability in Shopping List in flight - if checked the Shopping List will show, when not landed, the bodies in the current (or selected historic) system which have those materials, ordered by the highest percentage.

* Use EDSM Data in System Availability - if checked the system availability will include planet data from EDSM, if not then only bodies you have personally scanned will be included.

* Use Historic Material Counts - when checked the available materials are those that were available at the selected system in the [Main Travel Grid](https://github.com/EDDiscovery/EDDiscovery/wiki/Using-the-History-Tab), when it is unchecked the most recent known list of materials is always used.
