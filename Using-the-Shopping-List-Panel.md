The Shopping List panel combines the [Engineering](https://github.com/EDDiscovery/EDDiscovery/wiki/Using-the-Engineering-panel) and [Synthesis](https://github.com/EDDiscovery/EDDiscovery/wiki/Using-the-Synthesis-Panel) controls into a single panel.

Set the wanted values on both controls to produce a single shopping list for the required materials needed for the combined synthesis and engineering recipes.

The Engineering and Synthesis grids are hidden when the panel is made transparent allowing the list itself to be used as an overlay to the game.
