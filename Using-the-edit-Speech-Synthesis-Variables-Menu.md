This file defines the spoken phrases associated with program and journal events.

Many variables are used in this pack to read information from the events to you.  Description of these variables is beyond the scope of the wiki.  

If you wish to experiment a useful statement is pragma Dumpvars Event* at the start of a program which will show you all the variables associated with an event.  Associate a program to do this with an event you wish to investigate, then right click on the event and run actions on this event.
