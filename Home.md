# EDDiscovery - What is it?

You play Elite Dangerous and have heard of EDDiscovery - and ended up here.  So what _is_ it?  
  
In short it's a 3rd party tool that can track your Elite Dangerous travels, combat, trading, rank etc. Before Elite Dangerous 2.2 it could only track travel, now with 2.2+, EDDiscovery tracks much more! It can now log other data such as rank, commodities, materials, scans and all host of other data.

EDD works on the PC or the MAC.  Unfortunately Frontier does not or cannot support the API required on XBOX or PS4 to output journal entries to the PC/MAC for us to use.

EDDiscovery gives you a [[3D map|Using the 3D Map]] and [[2D maps|Using the 2D Map]] of the galaxy, showing travel history and data from EDSM and EDDB to aid your journey through the Elite Dangerous galaxy.

EDDiscovery supports [[add-ons|Using the manage Add Ons Menu]], which give you the ability to [[vocalise events |Using voice packs]], add [[keyboard shortcuts|Using key packs]], read and vocalise [[joystick inputs|Using the JKM Pack]], place information on [[OBS|Using the OBS Pack]], play [[MP3s when an event occurs|Using the SoundBlaster Pack]], plus others.

Here's an example of the history page using the [[ED Theme Elite Verdana|Configuring the look of EDDiscovery]], EDDiscovery supports themeing the user interface to your specification.

The main user interface of ED consists of (from top):

# Menu Bar
[[Menu Options|Menu Options]] for some quick access functions and to run housekeeping functions which seldom need executing.

# The Toolbar.  
* Commander: use to select which commander to display information about, or Hidden for entries you have hidden.
* Refresh: causes EDDiscovery to recheck the journal files
* [[2D Maps|Using the 2D Map]], [[3D Map|Using the 3D Map]]: open maps
* EDSM Sync: if you've configured EDSM sync in [[Settings Page|Using the Settings Page]] then this causes EDDiscovery to check for EDSM information and up and download it
* Log etc PopOut: select a pop out data panel (see below)
* Manage Add-Ons : install new add-ons
* Edit Add-Ons : edit or disable add-ons.

The toolbar can be instructed to roll up or stay expanded. When the mouse hovers over the toolbar, a pin on the far right (not shown) will show and you can either pin or unpin the toolbar.

# Tab Pages
A set of tab pages are shown below the toolbar.  These are:

* [[History|Using the History Page]] : The history page shows a list of events for your commander, as well as four selectable [[Panels|Using Panels]].
* [[Journal|Using the Journal Page]]
* [[Grid|Using the Grid Page]]
* [[Trilateration|Using the Trilateration Page]]
* [[Route|Using the Route Page]]
* [[Route/Expeditions|Using the Route Expeditions Page]]
* [[Settings|Using the Settings Page]]

Which you can select from. See the topics above for information on each page.  The tab you were on is remembered after exiting the program and selected next time you run.
