# EDDiscovery - What is it?

You play Elite Dangerous and have heard of EDDiscovery - and ended up here.  So what _is_ it?  
  
In short it's a 3rd party tool that can track your Elite Dangerous travels, combat, trading, rank etc. Before Elite Dangerous 2.2 it could only track travel, now with 2.2+, EDDiscovery tracks much more! It can now log other data such as rank, commodities, materials, scans and all host of other data.

EDD works on the PC.  Unfortunately Frontier does not or cannot support the API required on XBOX or PS4 to output journal entries to the PC for us to use.  MAC support was withdrawn due to lack of users.

EDDiscovery gives you a [[3D map|Using the 3D Map]] and [[2D maps|Using the 2D Map]] of the galaxy, showing travel history and data from EDSM and EDDB to aid your journey through the Elite Dangerous galaxy.

EDDiscovery supports [[add-ons|Using the manage Add Ons Menu]], which give you the ability to [[vocalise events |Using voice packs]], add [[keyboard shortcuts|Using key packs]], read and vocalise [[joystick inputs|Using the JKM Pack]], place information on [[OBS|Using the OBS Pack]], play [[MP3s when an event occurs|Using the SoundBlaster Pack]], plus others.

Here's an example of the history page using the [[ED Theme Elite Verdana|Configuring the look of EDDiscovery]], EDDiscovery supports themeing the user interface to your specification.

The main user interface of ED consists of (from top):

# Menu Bar
[[Menu Options|Menu Options]] for some quick access functions and to run housekeeping functions which seldom need executing.

# The Toolbar.  
* Commander: use to select which commander to display information about, or Hidden for entries you have hidden.
* Refresh: causes EDDiscovery to recheck the journal files
* [[2D Maps|Using the 2D Map]], [[3D Map|Using the 3D Map]]: open maps
* EDSM Sync: if you've configured EDSM sync in [[Settings|Using the Settings Panel]] then this causes EDDiscovery to check for EDSM information and up and download it
* Panel Selection Icon/List : Pop out a panel to another window
* Manage Add-Ons : install new add-ons
* Edit Add-Ons : edit or disable add-ons.

The toolbar can be instructed to roll up or stay expanded. When the mouse hovers over the toolbar, a pin on the far right (not shown) will show and you can either pin or unpin the toolbar.

# Panels
[[Panels|Using Panels]] are the basic UI building block of EDDiscovery. There are many (>25) panels, each one dedicated to a specific task or information display. Panels can be displayed in a tab, as part of the [[History Tab|Using the History Tab]] or popped out in a stand alone window (see the toolbar).  A [[Grid|Using the Grid]] panel can contain other panels to allow you to set up a configurable set of panels.

# Tab Pages
A set of tab pages are shown below the toolbar.  You can add or remove tabs (containing a panel) to the program by right clicking on the menu toolbar and selecting or removing a tab.  The only mandatory tab is the [[History Tab|Using the History Tab]] as the program must have at least one [[History Grid|Using the History Grid Panel]] present to work.

By default, at first run, EDDiscovery presents the user with a set of tabs containing the following panels: [[History Tab|Using the History Tab]], [[Route Panel|Using the Route Panel]], [[Expedition Panel|Using the Expeditions Panel]], [[Settings|Using the Settings Panel]]

The tab you were on is remembered after exiting the program and selected next time you run.  You can have multiple versions of the same panel present on the tab line.

If you have removed the [[Settings|Using the Settings panel]] by accident or just want it back, you can either right click the menu bar to add it back on, or using the Tools | Settings option.

# Other Information
