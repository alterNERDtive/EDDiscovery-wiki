# EDDiscovery – What is it? 

You play Elite Dangerous and have heard of EDDiscovery - and ended up here.  So what _is_ it?  
  
In short it’s a 3rd party tool that can track your Elite Dangerous travels, combat, trading, rank etc. Before Elite Dangerous 2.2 it could only track travel, now with 2.2, EDDiscovery tracks much more! It can now log other data such as rank, commodities, materials, scans and all host of other data.

EDDiscovery also gives you a 3D and 2D maps of the galaxy, showing travel history and data from EDSM and EDDB to aid your journey through the Elite Dangerous galaxy.

Here’s an example of the history page using the ED Theme Elite Verdana:
