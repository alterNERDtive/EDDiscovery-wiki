# Current Version

10.4.X Series is now the current EDD

See [[Release Notes|https://github.com/EDDiscovery/EDDiscovery/releases]]

[[Download the latest version|https://github.com/EDDiscovery/EDDiscovery/releases/latest]]

# Troubleshooting
Problems running it? Crashing? See [[Troubleshooting|Troubleshooting]] and check out [[Safe Mode|Safe Mode]] to allow you to fix issues and [[Move the Databases|Move databases]] to another folder.

Also see [[Settings History settings|Using the Settings Panel]] to allow you to limit the amount of memory EDD consumes.

Also, if your putting the program on a Hard Disk Drive (not an SDD), the volume of data from EDSM on stars is now large.  Initially setting up the DB will take a considerable amount of time.  You may solve this either by using an SDD to host, or when the program is first run (or later via the Galaxy selector on settings) selecting a small amount of the galaxy to store.

# EDDiscovery - What is it?

You play Elite Dangerous and have heard of EDDiscovery - and ended up here.  So what _is_ it?  
  
In short it's a 3rd party tool that can track your Elite Dangerous travels, combat, trading, rank etc. Before Elite Dangerous 2.2 it could only track travel, now with 2.2+, EDDiscovery tracks much more! It can now log other data such as rank, commodities, materials, scans and all host of other data.

EDD works on the PC.  Unfortunately Frontier does not or cannot support the API required on XBOX or PS4 to output journal entries to the PC for us to use.  MAC support was withdrawn due to lack of users, and now is not supported by Frontier.

EDDiscovery gives you the following major features:

* [[Shows your ED History|Using the History Tab]]
* [[Shows your current Materials State|Using the Materials Panel]], [[Commodity State|Using the Commodities Panel]], [[Mission Lists|Using the Missions Panel]] and many other [[panels|Using Panels]] exist to provide other information
* [[Plan your Expeditions|Using the Expeditions Panel]]
* [[Plan your Exploration|Using the Exploration Panel]]
* [[Has a 3D map of the galaxy|Using the 3D Map]] showing travel history and data from EDSM and EDDB to aid your journey through the Elite Dangerous galaxy.
* [[2D map|Using the 2D Map]] 

EDDiscovery supports [[add-ons|Using the manage Add Ons Menu]], which give you the ability to:

* [[Vocalise Elite Events as they are received |Using voice packs]]
* [[Control EDD using your voice using the Free Voice Control pack|Free Voice Control]]
* [[Keyboard shortcuts to control EDD|Using key packs]] 
* Read and vocalise [[joystick inputs|Using the JKM Pack]]
* Place information on [[OBS|Using the OBS Pack]]
* Play [[MP3s when an event occurs|Using the SoundBlaster Pack]], plus others.
* Integrate with [[3rd party DLLs|3rd Party DLL Support]]

EDDiscovery has been [[Translated|Translations]] into a few other languages.  You can change the language you want to see on the [[Settings Panel|Using the Settings Panel]].

EDDiscovery integrates with our partner Elite 3rd party developer tools:

* [[EDSM|EDSM integration with EDDiscovery]]
* [[Inara|Inara integration with EDDiscovery]]
* [[EGO|EGO integration with EDDiscovery]]
* [[EDDB|EDDB integration with EDDiscovery]]
* [[Coriolis|Coriolis integration with EDDiscovery]]
* [[ED Shipyard|ED Shipyard integration with EDDiscovery]]
* EDDN Network : Run by [EDCD](https://edcd.github.io/), this distributes information on shipyards, markets, stations, scans to the EDCD community (EDSM, EDDB, etc). 

Use [[the Settings Panel|Using the Settings Panel]] to configure these options.

Here's an example of the history page using the [[ED Theme Elite Verdana|Configuring the look of EDDiscovery]], EDDiscovery supports themeing the user interface to your specification.

The main user interface of ED consists of (from top):

# Menu Bar
[[Menu Options|Menu Options]] for some quick access functions and to run housekeeping functions which seldom need executing.

# The Toolbar.  
* Commander: use to select which commander to display information about, or Hidden for entries you have hidden.
* Refresh: causes EDDiscovery to recheck the journal files
* [[Profile|Profiles]]: Change to another profile or define new profiles. A profile holds all your setup of EDD such as which panels and pop outs, and their configuration settings.
* [[2D Maps|Using the 2D Map]], [[3D Map|Using the 3D Map]]: open maps
* EDSM Sync: if you've configured EDSM sync in [[Settings|Using the Settings Panel]] then this causes EDDiscovery to check for EDSM information and up and download it
* Panel Selection Icon/List : Pop out a panel to another window
* Manage Add-Ons : install new add-ons
* Edit Add-Ons : edit or disable add-ons.

The toolbar can be instructed to roll up or stay expanded. When the mouse hovers over the toolbar, a pin on the far right (not shown) will show and you can either pin or unpin the toolbar.

# Panels
[[Panels|Using Panels]] are the basic UI building block of EDDiscovery. There are many (>25) panels, each one dedicated to a specific task or information display. Panels can be displayed in a tab, as part of the [[History Tab|Using the History Tab]] or popped out in a stand alone window (see the toolbar).  A [[Grid|Using the Grid]] or [[Splitter|Using the Splitter]] panel can contain other panels to allow you to set up a configurable set of panels.  See [[Panels|Using Panels]] for help on how to control the transparency of some panels.

# Tab Pages
A set of tab pages are shown below the toolbar.  You can add or remove tabs (containing a panel) to the program by right clicking on the menu toolbar and selecting or removing a tab. You can rename tabs. The only mandatory tab is the [[History Tab|Using the History Tab]] as the program must have at least one [[History Grid|Using the History Grid Panel]] present to work.

By default, at first run, EDDiscovery presents the user with a set of tabs containing the following panels: [[History Tab|Using the History Tab]], [[Route Panel|Using the Route Panel]], [[Expedition Panel|Using the Expeditions Panel]], [[Settings|Using the Settings Panel]]

The tab you were on is remembered after exiting the program and selected next time you run.  You can have multiple versions of the same panel present on the tab line.

If you have removed the [[Settings|Using the Settings panel]] by accident or just want it back, you can either right click the menu bar to add it back on, or using the Tools | Settings option.

# Other Information
