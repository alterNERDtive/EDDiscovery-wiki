# EDDiscovery - What is it?

You play Elite Dangerous and have heard of EDDiscovery - and ended up here.  So what _is_ it?  
  
In short it's a 3rd party tool that can track your Elite Dangerous travels, combat, trading, rank etc. Before Elite Dangerous 2.2 it could only track travel, now with 2.2, EDDiscovery tracks much more! It can now log other data such as rank, commodities, materials, scans and all host of other data.

EDDiscovery also gives you a [[3D map|Using the 3D Map]] and [[2D maps|Using the 2D Map]] of the galaxy, showing travel history and data from EDSM and EDDB to aid your journey through the Elite Dangerous galaxy.

Here's an example of the history page using the [[ED Theme Elite Verdana|Configuring the look of EDDiscovery]], EDDiscovery supports themeing the user interface to your specification.

The main user interface of ED consists of a set of tab pages

* [[History|Using the History Page]] : The history page supports four selectable [[Panels|Using Panels]] which you can select what information is displayed.
* [[Journal|Using the Journal Page]]
* [[Trilateration|Using the Trilateration Page]]
* [[Screenshots|Using the Screenshots Page]]
* [[Route|Using the Route Page]]
* [[Route/Expeditions|Using the Route Expeditions Page]]
* [[Export|Using the Export Page]]
* [[Settings|Using the Settings Page]]

Which you can select from. See the topics above for information on each page.

EDDiscovery also has [[Menu Options|Menu Options]] for some quick access functions and to run housekeeping functions which seldom need executing.

[[Configuration Options|Configuration Options]] exist to control how EDDiscovery starts and where data is stored.
