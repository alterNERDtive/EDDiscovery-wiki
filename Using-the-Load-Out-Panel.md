The drop down at the top (after ship) selected either the travel history position or a particular ship.

At the top is the Coriolis and ED Shipyard integration buttons (see later) and the ship user identifier (if given), user name (if given), Normalised name, identity number (in brackets), and fuel and cargo capacity.

Each module is listed with the following details:

* Type: The module type
* Item: the module detailed item name including the class and rating.
* Slot: where its stored
* Info: Any other information on the item
* Mass: The mass of the module
* BluePrint: Any Engineering blue prints.  
* Value: Value of the module. 
* Priority/Enable.  Give the priority and enable state (E) of the module.  If E is missing, its disabled. This is only given on game start or when buying a new ship, so may be missing.

Not all information may be available.  

Information on total mass, fuel capacity, FSD specs, thruster specs is also listed.

Clicking on the Coriolis or ED Shipyard button sends the loadout (as long as there is enough detail) to your webbrowser on the chosen site, where you can save/modify the load out.

The small ship icon allows you to enter user configuration data on the ship, as follows:
