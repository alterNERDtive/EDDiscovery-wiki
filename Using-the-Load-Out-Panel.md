The load out panel shows you the load out of either the ship at the current selected travel history entry, or the last loadout of a particular ship.

The drop down at the top (after ship) selected either the travel history position or a particular ship.

At the top is the Coriolis integration button (see later) and the ship user identifier (if given), user name (if given), Normalised name, identity number (in brackets), and fuel and cargo capacity.

Each module is listed with the following details:

* Slot: where it is installed.
* Item: the normalised frontier name of the item, giving the type, class and rating.
* Name: the localised version of this name.  Frontier do not always give this value (only when buying/selling a module) so it may be missing.
* Ammo: The ammo clip size and total.  This is only given on a some modules, and only at the game start or when buying a new ship, so may be missing.
* BluePrint: Any Engineering blue prints.  Frontier do not give the actual modification details of the blueprint, so the integration with Coriolis cannot take this into account
* Value: Value of the module. 
* Priority/Enable.  Give the priority and enable state (E) of the module.  If E is missing, its disabled. This is only given on game start or when buying a new ship, so may be missing.

Not all information will be available.  Some information is new in 2.3 so entries before 2.3 will not be as full as new ones.

Clicking on the Coriolis button sends the loadout (as long as there is enough detail) to your webbrowser/Coriolis, where you can save/modify the load out.
