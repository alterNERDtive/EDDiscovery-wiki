The EDSM panel shows you the web page for the system which the travel history cursor (or Journal/star list if your using splitters/grids) is pointing at.

If EDSM does not have a known system, it shows the main EDSM page.

It will auto refresh to the next system on a jump if you have the Cursor to Top enabled in your travel page.

You can browse around EDSM using this view to other pages on the EDSM web site only.  Jumping to external sites is disabled.  

Use this at your own risk - its using Internet Explorer (your current version) and its therefore exposed to any naughty web site issues which may have viruses which try and infect your computer.  This is why its locked to EDSM only. EDD cannot take responsibility (see license terms) if anything happens.
