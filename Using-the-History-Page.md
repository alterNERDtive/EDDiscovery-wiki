The page is split into the following view areas:

Each view can be resized, as shown above, against its siblings. The split between the left and right view sets can be adjusted.

Two of the views are fixed:

* Travel Grid (Top Left)
* User Controls and System Report on currently selected item on Travel Grid (Top Right)

Three of the views are configurable:

* Bottom Left View
* Right Middle View
* Right Bottom View

The system report shows you information about the current system that is selected by the travel grid cursor.  It also shows you any notes you made about the travel grid entry. It has an EDSM, EDDBId and ROSS button to take you directly to the appropriate web pages for that system.

Finally, the current target system is shown, with the distance to go.  You can set the target designator either thru the [Using the 3DMap](the 3D Map), or by typing in a system or galaxy object here.

# Configuring the three views
You can configure these bottom views and select different data panels to display on each view.  Hover the cursor over the tab bar area above the view as shown below.  After a short interval, a set of icons appear which will allow you to select different information to view in that view area.
