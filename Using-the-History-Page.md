The history page is the main information and control page of EDDiscovery. Here you can see the history of your travels through the galaxy, find data about these entries.

The page is split into the following view areas:

Each view can be resized, as shown above, against its siblings. The split between the left and right view sets can be adjusted.

Two of the views are fixed:

* Travel Grid (Top Left)
* User Controls and System Report on currently selected item on Travel Grid (Top Right)

Three of the views are configurable:

* Bottom Left View
* Right Middle View
* Right Bottom View

# Using the Travel Grid

* PopOut - select a pop out data panel (see below)
* S-Panel - launch the nitty [SPanel](Using the SPanel) which you can place over the top of Elite Dangerous and give you information when you are playing the game
* EDSM Sync - if you've configured EDSM sync in [Settings Page](Using the Settings Page) then this causes EDDiscovery to check for EDSM information and up and download it

The system report shows you information about the current system that is selected by the travel grid cursor.  It also shows you any notes you made about the travel grid entry. It has an EDSM, EDDBId and ROSS button to take you directly to the appropriate web pages for that system.

Finally, the current target system is shown, with the distance to go.  You can set the target designator either thru the [the 3D Map](Using the 3DMap), or by typing in a system or galaxy object here.

# Configuring the three views
You can configure these bottom views and select different data panels to display on each view.  Hover the cursor over the tab bar area above the view as shown below.  After a short interval, a set of icons appear which will allow you to select different information to view in that view area.

Clicking on the icon changes the view to that data. You can also pop out the data panels to their own separate window, either by right clicking on a particular icon and selecting pop out, or by using the pop out icon (box with arrow) for the current data panel in the view.
