The page is split into the following views:

pic - views

Each view can be resized, as shown above, against its siblings.  The split between the left and right view sets can be adjusted.

Two of the views are fixed:

* Travel Grid (Top Left)
* User Controls and System Report on currently selected item on Travel Grid (Top Right)

Three of the views are configurable:

* Bottom Left View
* Right Middle View
* Right Bottom View

# Using the Travel Grid
See the [Using the Travel Grid](travel grid) topic for help in use of this

# Using the User Controls

# System Report

<pic>

This shows you information about the current system that is selected by the travel grid cursor.  It also shows you any notes you made about the travel grid entry, and any target you have set up to travel to (targets are configured on [Using the 3DMap](the 3D Map) or by entering the target name directly in the dialog box).

# Configuring the three views
You can configure these bottom views and select different data panels to display on each view.  Hover the cursor over the tab bar area above the view as shown below.  After a short interval, a set of icons appear which will allow you to select different information to view in that view area.

Clicking on the icon changes the view to that data. You can also pop out the data panels to their own separate window, either by right clicking on a particular icon and selecting pop out, or by using the pop out icon (box with arrow) for the current data panel in the view.
