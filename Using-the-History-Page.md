The history page is the main information and control page of EDDiscovery. Here you can see the history of your travels through the galaxy, find data about these entries.

The page is split into the following view areas:

Each view can be resized, as shown above, against its siblings. The split between the left and right view sets can be adjusted.

Two of the views are fixed:

* [History Grid](Using the History Grid) (Top Left)
* User Controls and System Report on currently selected item on Travel Grid (Top Right)

Three of the views are configurable:

* Bottom View
* Middle Right View
* Bottom Right View

# Using the History Grid

* Refresh: causes EDDiscovery to recheck the journal files
* Cmdr: use to select which commander to display information about, or Hidden for entries you have hidden
* [2D Maps](Using the 2D Map), [3D Map](Using the 3D Map): open maps
* PopOut: select a pop out data panel (see below)
* S-Panel + more: launch a pop out window (see below)
* EDSM Sync: if you've configured EDSM sync in [Settings Page](Using the Settings Page) then this causes EDDiscovery to check for EDSM information and up and download it

The system report shows you information about the current system that is selected by the travel grid cursor.  It also shows you any notes you made about the travel grid entry. It has an EDSM, EDDBId and ROSS button to take you directly to the appropriate web pages for that system.

Finally, the current target system is shown, with the distance to go.  You can set the target designator either thru the [the 3D Map](Using the 3D Map), or by typing in a system or galaxy object here.

# Configuring the three views
You can configure these bottom views and select different data panels to display on each view.  Hover the cursor over the tab bar area above the view as shown below.  After a short interval, a set of icons appear which will allow you to select different information to view in that view area.
