The system information panel defaults to this view:

The system information panel uses the entry selected by its associated journal or travel grid to select what system to report on.  For the system information panel on the history page, then the main travel grid is used. If on a grid, and a journal or travel grid is shown, it will use that grid to steer which system it is displaying.

The panel shows information on the system, your credits, your journal notes, the target selection (and allows you to set it), ship information, materials, data and commodity counts at that point in your history.  If you've set up a start and stop points, it will show accumulated travel information.  It will also show game mode and group.  It provides three buttons to jump to EDSM, Ross or EDDB directly.

Right click on a blank area to get the configuration drop down menu:

You can select:
* Which fields are shown.  
* Indicate if a more skinny look is wanted when transparent
* Reset back to the start configuration
* Remove all items (may be easier to remove all then add if you only want one or two items)
* Select if EDSM buttons are attached to the system name or on a separate line.

The panel can be re-ordered.  To do this, with ctrl held down, left click on text box or label, and then drag it over the item you want to insert it before.  Or you can drag it up/down and to the right to make it into more columns:

There are eight columns available, by as many rows as needed to display all the fields selected.

Here is one set up for transparency.  To do this, pop out a system information panel (using the pop out drop down on the toolbar, set it up using the transparency controls on the top right of the pop out, turn off caption, and then re-configure the order using ctrl-drag and selecting these items only)
