You can pick one of the default themes, available via the drop down menu.  You can configure if the program is always on top.  And by using the Edit Theme dialog you can configure each visual element individually (the swatches and settings shown below are the ones to configure for the Elite Verdana style):

If you want permanently store the edited theme, either so you can select another one for now, or to share the theme with others, you can save the theme to disk.  The newly created theme will them be available (if stored in the default folder) in the drop down box.
