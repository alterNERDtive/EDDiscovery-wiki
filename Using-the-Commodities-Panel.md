The commodities count panel shows the current state and number of known commodities recorded by the Journal, at the [[history cursor|Using the History Grid]] position.

At each game start, and as each Commodity is bought, sold or ejected, Elite Dangerous places a entry in the journal indicating this.

EDDiscovery tracks these and provides you with totals at the point the history where the history cursor is.  If its at the top of the history window, its the current count.  

As you scroll the cursor through the entries, the table updates to show you the state at that point.  

EDDiscovery monitors all usage of commodities.

From 2.3, ED gives us the total of the commodities at game start, so the previous method of manually entering totals is removed in 6.2 onwards.
