Since Elite Dangerous 2.1, trilateration (finding the system co-ordinates by using other known systems) is no longer required.  

A niche use case exists to find position of systems which were visited before 2.1 and have unknown co-ordinates in EDSM.

Trilateration from a system consists of measuring distances between stars using the ED Galaxy map, and then inputting these distances into ED Discovery.  Once enough distances have been measured a star position can be calculated.

Click Start new to begin, then copy a star from the right panel into the left panel (click on it).  Look up the distance in ED, enter it, click another star etc until enough entries are entered to allow for a good computation.
