# Elite Galaxy Online integration with EDDiscovery

Update Autumn 2019.

I'm afraid EGO seems to be no more. If it does not appear again the code to integrate with it will be removed.


## Overview
[EGO](http://www.elitegalaxyonline.com/) (Elite Galaxy Online) is an online database maintaining a list of record-breaking discoveries. By adding integration into EDDiscovery you can automatically upload discoveries to EGO as you explore.

## Configuration - EGO
Create an account, if you haven't already, and generate an API key.

This is found under the User drop-down in "User API Key".

## Configuration - EDDiscovery

<TODO>

Open settings tab, highlight your Commander, and click on "Configuration". Find the EGO settings, enter your EGO login and API key.
