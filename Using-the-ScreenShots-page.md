The screenshot page allows you to configure EDDiscovery to automatically recognise screenshots taken either inside Elite Dangerous (F10) or via Steam, and convert and rename them into another format.  Additionally you can crop them if required.

# Settings Panel (top)

Options here are:

* Auto convert: turn on/off screen shot system

* ED/Steam Screenshot directory: Set this to the correct folder. See below.

* Converted Pictures: Where to put the files after conversion.

* Save As: What format to put the files in (note BMP cannot be used if the converted pictures folder is the same as ED screenshot folder)

* Scan For: What files to scan for. Select BMP for ED launcher/ED, JPG/PNG (as selected by steam).

* Remove original image after conversion: Select to delete the original screenshot

* Mark High Resolution Files: Add a marker to show in the filename its Hi Res (ED Screenshots only)

* File Name Format: Use the drop down to select your preferred naming schema.

# Finding the correct folder to set the directory to:

The correct folder for screenshots taken with Elite Dangerous is c:\users\<user name>\Pictures\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous.  Replace <user name> with your user name. Do a test screenshot and them ensure that .BMPs are in there from ED.

For steam, this depends on where you store your steam game files, but it should be <Steam root folder>/userdata/<steam ID>/<ED ID>/screenshots
