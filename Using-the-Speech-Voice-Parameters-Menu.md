The voice parameter menu allows the speech output to be further controlled.  

* Many options are supports to turn on or off various speech output. See the dialog.
* Disable voice output stops the voice from sounding, but the pack still runs.  Useful if you are logging speech
* Speech file allows all speech output to be logged to a file.  You can have the date time printed, and you can cause the file to be cleared before each phrase is written (Log last only).  This is useful for OBS, as OBS can print a text file on screen and thus you could be showing your viewers the speech output
* Exclude stars.  Give here a list of stars types and scan details won't be read out for that class of star.
