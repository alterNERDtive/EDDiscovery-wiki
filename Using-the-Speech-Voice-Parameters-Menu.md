The voice parameter menu allows the speech output to be further controlled:

* The verbosity, from 0 to 4, allows you to tell certain long phrased events (Scan, Jump) how verbose to be. 0 is minimum, 1 is normal, 4 is very vocal.
* Disable voice output stops the voice from sounding, but the pack still runs.  Useful if you are logging speech
* Speech file allows all speech output to be logged to a file.  You can have the date time printed, and you can cause the file to be cleared before each phrase is writte (Log last only).  This is useful for OBS, as OBS can print a text file on screen and thus you could be showing your viewers the speech output
* Exclude stars.  Give here a list of stars types and scan details won't be read out for that class of star.
* First Jump Only. If set, only on the first arrival into a system does the read out of star information occur.
