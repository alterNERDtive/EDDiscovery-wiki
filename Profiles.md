Profiles allow save and select the visual configuration of EDD to a named profile.  You can then go to the profile and EDD will reconfigure itself (its tabs, popouts and all the panel settings) to that configuration.  You can have as many configurations as you desire.

To use, use the profile drop down on the toolbar:

You can select a previous profile directly.  Default is always there.  To create or delete profiles, use the Edit profiles selection.  This then gives you the profile editor:

The profile editor allows you to create (+) a new profile, to Delete (x) a profile, to set a profile as the default to use on EDD start (Default box).  

To create a new profile, click on +, give it a name, then OK the profile.  To use it, use the drop down menu to go to the profile.  Then configure its settings, changing the panels and pop outs to suit.  You may call two profiles by the same name if you strangely desire that.

Note you cannot copy profiles, that is not supported at this time due to complexity.  

The final feature is triggers. EDD can be configured to switch to another profile due to an Elite Journal or UI event.

To configure a profile to trigger due to an event, use the drop down with "No Trigger" in the combo box.  Select one to the triggers. EDD has defined a few basic triggers - such as Docked/Undocked. 

You can then configure a set of profiles for EDD configuration when on a planet, while docked, while in space, etc.

The Trigger/Back buttons allow you to configure the trigger conditions manually - this is more complicated.  You can see from some of the built in triggers how it detects conditions to change profiles on.

No Trigger in the profile means it needs to be manually selected.
