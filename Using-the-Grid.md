The grid, new to 8.2, allows you to show any number of panels on either the main grid page, or on a pop out grid.  Grids can be placed into grids, if required:

Here you have a journal grid on the left; a material grid on the top right; a grid on the bottom right consisting of another materials grid and a ledger grid, overlapped.

To pop out a new panel, use the drop down box (labeled 'log' here) to select the panel.  It will then appear on the grid. Hover over any of its edges and left mouse button drag to change its position.  It will highlight to show its selected.  

To delete a panel, click on the edge of the panel to highlight it, and then click on the trash can icon. Here the top right panel is highlighted, and the trash can is enabled:

You can auto arrange the panels using the grid icon next to the trash can.

Panels can overlap, select the order of the panels by selecting a panel, it comes to the front of the order.

Grids can be popped out and made transparent:
