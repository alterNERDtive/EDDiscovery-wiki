This pack adds on voice prompts to keys/buttons pressed on your input devices: Mouse, Keyboard, Joystick.

Once enabled, you can check under Add-Ons | List Joystick.. menu option if it successfully bound your key bindings from elite with your input devices.  The log window will also show any errors.

The bindings are read at power up of EDD only.  Any changes you make in Elite to the bindings are not dynamically updated.

Keys/Buttons bound to UI actions are not vocalised even if they are bound to other actions, due to the inability to tell what UI mode Elite is in.
