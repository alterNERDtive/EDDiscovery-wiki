EDD can be configured to update the Elite Dangerous Developer Network [EDDN](https://eddn.edcd.io) with data you accumulate as you travel.  

You can see the type of data EDD will send to EDDN [at this address](https://github.com/EDSM-NET/EDDN/tree/master/schemas).  Note any personal identifiable information is removed from your journal entries before its sent to the system.

Contributing to EDDN means that your improving the data set which powers [EDDB](https://eddb.io/) and [EDSM](https://www.edsm.net/) which I'm sure you've used in the past to help you succeed in Elite Dangerous.

You can enable the EDDN feed, on a per commander basis, using the [[Commander editing dialog from the Settings panel|Using the Settings Panel]]
