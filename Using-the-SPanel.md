The scan panel is useful to place over the top of Elite Dangerous. Make sure ED is in borderless graphics mode.

The scan panel in non transparent mode with caption on looks like this:

The icons along the top configure it.  T means transparent on/off, C means caption("Summary panel") on/off, the box with dots mean show in taskbar on/off.  The empty rectangle is top most on/off, finally minimise and close.

With transparent on and caption off you get this:

Position this over ED, size it as required, and you will get update as journal events occur right in front of you in ED!

Right click on the panel to configure it:

Here you can turn on/off various fields, configure the look, turn off the panel when docked, change the column order, configure which events are shown, set up a field filter to remove events, and finally decide to display the full scan results when scanning and where to position them.

The field widths can be configured. Hover over the top of the box and the divers appear:

Move the divers to configure your window.  Note if you change what fields are shown, the divers are reset to their default values.
