SPanel is going to go under improvement.

For using the current Spanel, position it over the top of where Elite Dangerous is positioned (ED must be in Borderless mode).  

Right click on the panel to configure columns and data, add on exploration scans.

Move the cursor to the top of the panel and a set of dividers appear which allow you to set the tab stops of the panel.
