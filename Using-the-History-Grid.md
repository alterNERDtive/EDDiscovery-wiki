The history grid present a list of events entries.  Each event is named, given an icon to help you recognise it, and optionally has data fields to describe the event in more detail.

The grid consists of the following columns:

* Time: (either Game time (UTC) or Time (Local), set this up [using the settings page](Using the Settings Page).
* Event: Icons describing the event, plus other icons for start/stop journey, Map entry colour, etc
* Description: short description of the event
* Information: more detailed information about the event
* Notes: any notes you made about the event.

Hover over an entry to see any expanded information about the event:

Double click on the event and it will expand the row height and show you all the information it has about the event.

# Sorting and Filtering

Each column is sortable, click on the column header to sort under that item.

Using the Time drop down selection, you can filter events by how long ago they occurred.

Using the Search text box, you can filter events by if they contain this bit of text (any Column).

Using the Event Filter drop down, you can filter events by specific event types

# Column Resizing

Columns automatically resize when you change the size of the EDDiscovery window.  They also remember their widths over a shutdown of the program.

# Selecting multiple entries

You can click drag down on the grid to select multiple entries at one time for right clicking.

# Right Click options

Right click either on a previous selection or a entry and you will be presented with the following options:

* Go to star on 3D Map : Open the [3D Map](Using the 3D Map) and go to this system.

* Star Map Colour: Set the colour to show on the 3D Map for this entry.

* Hide Entries: Clicking on a range, or a single entry, and using this moves the entry to the hidden commander.  You can see hidden entries by using the [commander selection drop down](Using the History Page) to select 'Hidden commander'.  You can then move them back to another commander using the next option.

* Move Entries to another Commander: **Advanced**. Move the entry to another commander.  Not recommended now, since ED Discovery 2.2, but retained to support older entries from 2.1 and before.

* Add To: Add system or systems to one of the trilateration dialogs or to the routing page

* View On EDSM: Open a web page on this system

* Assign New System: **Advanced**. If EDSM and ED disagree about the system, allows you to pick another EDSM system to attach this entry to.  ED has instances of repeated names, so this can correct this.

* Set Start/Stop point for travel calculations: Use to set up travel calculation of distance and time by setting start and end points

* Remove Journal Entry: **Advanced, Caution**. Delete this entry entirely.  Use with caution. Useful for the EDD Set Item entry (which the user creates).  If journals are rescanned, the entry may reappear.
