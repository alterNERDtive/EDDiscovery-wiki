A splitter panel is a type of panel which can hold multiple other panels inside it.  It is analogous to the grid panel, but uses windows splitters instead of movable windows.

The history tab is a type of splitter with a fixed travel history grid and configurable number of splits.

Once created, a splitter panel has a minimum of a single splitter giving two panels. Right click on the splitter bar and the options to change the orientation of the splitter, and further split or merge the two panels the splitter splits is given.

By using this, changing orientation, etc, you can set up any number of panel windows in different configurations.

Each panel window by default is empty.  Click on the panel selector in the panel (hover over the title area) to select a panel to display in that panel area.
