The Voice Action Pack adds on voice responses to EDD.

Install this pack via the [[Manage Add-ons|Using the manage Add-Ons Menu]] menu.

The voice pack adds on extra menu items to the add-on menu:

* Use the [[Speech Synthesis Settings|Using the Speech Synthesis Settings Menu]] to configure the voice you want to use and apply effects to it.

* Use the [[Configure Voice Parameters|Using the Speech Voice Parameters Menu]] to configure the speech output and set the verbosity.

* [[Edit in text current speech synthesis variables|Using the edit Speech Synthesis Variables Menu]] For the speech pack, a quick way to go to the definition file for the speech variables which are used to determine what to say for each event. You may also want to translate the file.  Contact the ED Discovery team if you wish to do that, we can tell you how to do it.

See the [[action help|Using Actions]] for a document describing what the functions mean.

Use the Add-ons | Edit Add-on Action Files to bring up a menu showing the packs installed.  Hit Edit on the voice pack to edit the file (ensure you have installed it first!):
