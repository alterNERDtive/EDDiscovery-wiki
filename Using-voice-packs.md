The Voice Action Pack adds on voice responses to EDD.

Install this pack via the [[Manage Add-ons|Using the manage Add-Ons Menu]] menu.

Use the [[Speech Synthesis Settings|Using the Speech Synthesis Settings Menu]] to configure the voice you want to use.

For advanced users who wish to tailour the phrases, use the [[Edit in text current speech synthesis variables|Using the edit Speech Synthesis Variables Menu]] to go directly to the definition file which associates a journal event or program event with a spoken phrase.

You may also want to translate it.  if so, once you have changed the file, please contact the Discovery team on discord and we can update the voice pack to have your translation in it!

See the [[action help|Using Actions]] for a document describing what the functions mean.

Hitting F8 (if you have the keypack) or using the Edit Add-On menu option brings up the Action editor.  At the bottom left, ensure you have the voice pack selected:
