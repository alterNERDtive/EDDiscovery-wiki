You can define, load and save an exploration list of stars you wish to investigate.  It will show you the visit count, how many scans are there, the primary star etc after you have scanned them.  Its a very useful tool to keep track of exploring a region of space.

Each exploration set is saved in a file. You can load and save them using the toolbar buttons.  You can give an description to the set using the box underneath the file name.
