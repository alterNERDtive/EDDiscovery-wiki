The soundblaster pack plays a sound when any event occurs.

It requires you to point to a folder where your mp3s for each event is stored.

When an event occurs (say HullDamage,Docked, etc - note we do not include the space in the name) it looks in the folder for a file called <eventname>.mp3 (so HullDamage.mp3).  If present, it plays the sound.  If not present, no sound.

Audacity and Youtube are your friend to make up appropriate sound files.
