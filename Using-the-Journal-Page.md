The journal page (and also Grid) shows a simpler view of the history, with a single view, and with all the data expanded out.

The grid consists of the following columns:

* Time: (either Game time (UTC) or Time (Local), set this up [using the settings page](Using the Settings Page).
* Event: Icons describing the event, plus other icons for start/stop journey, Map entry colour, etc
* Description: short description of the event
* Information: more detailed information about the event

As all information is presented about an entry, no hover over or double click to expand is needed.

# Sorting and Filtering

Each column is sortable, click on the column header to sort under that item.

Using the Time drop down selection, you can filter events by how long ago they occurred.

Using the Search text box, you can filter events by if they contain this bit of text (any Column).

Using the Event Filter drop down, you can filter events by specific event types

# Column Resizing

Columns automatically resize when you change the size of the EDDiscovery window.  They also remember their widths over a shutdown of the program.

# Selecting multiple entries

You can click drag down on the grid to select multiple entries at one time for right clicking.

# Right Click options

Right click either on a previous selection or a entry and you will be presented with the following options (a more limited selection than [the history grid](Using the History Grid) ):
