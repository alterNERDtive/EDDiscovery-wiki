The scan panel shows you the known stars and planets of a system, due to a system scan of it, for the system selected by the [[history window cursor|Using the History Grid]].

You can select what is shown by using the toolbar above the star:

* Show/Hide Materials: Show materials, as seen here, or not (a small icon will show materials are present)

* Show Rare Materials only: For the people who only care about them.

* Show/Hide Materials that have reached their storage limits: Don't show ones you don't need.

* Show/Hide Moons: Diable showing moons, planets and stars only

* Planet size:  4 sizing options are given

* EDSM: Grab EDSM data on the system to supplement your own data

* Show/Hide Body Status Icons: Turn on/off showing volanism, terraformable and value icons.

* Export to Excel: Output data in an CSV output for excel etc.

The toolbar can be hidden. Right click on an empty part and you can choose to hide the icons and leave only the value indicator.

Body Status Icons are:

* If a planet is Terraformable : A picture of the planet earth.

* If a planet has Volcanism : A volcano erupting

* If a planet has an estimated value >50000cr : A $ (your in the money!)

Hovering over a item shows you a text description of it.  Clicking on a planet pops up a note with the same data.

Clicking on empty space closes the note.

The blue line around the planet or moon indicates its landable.  Multiple rings are shown by a gap in the ring.
