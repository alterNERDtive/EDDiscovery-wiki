The materials count panel shows the current state and number of known materials recorded by the Journal, at the [history cursor](Using the History Grid) position.

At game start, and as each Material is collected, used or discarded, Elite Dangerous places a entry in the journal indicating this.

EDDiscovery counts these instances and provides you with totals at the point the history where the history cursor is.  If its at the top of the history window, its the current count.  As you scroll the cursor through the entries, the table updates to show you the state at that point.  

EDDiscovery monitors all usage and collection of materials.

From 2.3, ED gives us the total of the materials at game start, so the previous method of manually entering totals is removed in 6.2 onwards.

# Auto Removing Materials with zero count

Click on remove zero items to have EDDiscovery remove items which have zero counts.  They will be removed at the next point when a new material is used or collected.
