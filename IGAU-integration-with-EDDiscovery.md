# Intergalactic Astronomical Union integration with EDDiscovery

Update March 2020.

## Overview
[IGAU](https://elite-igau.github.io/) (Intergalactic Astronomical Union) is a scientific research and exploration squadron which maintains a catalog of discoveries. By adding integration into EDDiscovery you can automatically upload discoveries to IGAU as you explore.

IGAU makes their discovery catalog pubic, and available in a simple, and easy to use .csv format at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elite-IGAU/publications/master/IGAU_Codex.csv

The discovery catalog is updated monthly to help deter discovery poachers and stalkers.
