Clicking on the [[Safe mode|Safe Mode]] Move Databases option will present this dialog:

This allows you to change the location of the databases (local\t16 in this case) to another folder. If you click OK, the program will ask for a folder location, and then move the databases to that folder.  It will provide confirmation that this has happened.

EDDiscovery remembers where you have placed the databases by writing a dboptions.txt file in your application data folder. Do not edit or remove this file as then you will lose the link to the location of the new databases.
