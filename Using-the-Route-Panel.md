The route panel uses the data collected from EDSM by EDDiscovery and allows you to plot a route throughout the whole galaxy.  

![Routing Page](http://i.imgur.com/dOrvDIN.png)

You select either a system or galaxy object name (in the From and To Boxes) or enter a X/Y/Z co-ordinate in either if you want to go to an unexplored place.

You can autopopulate the To and From boxes with either the currently selected [history grid](Using the History Grid) entry or the target system or object.

Select the maximum jump distance. Use either the maximum jump range of your ship, or for long galactic journeys use say 900 ly and then use the frontier in game router to jump between each waypoint given here. The router will warn you if your selecting a very large number of jumps.

Hit Find Route and it will calculate the route. Shown here is Sol to Lembava.  

You can, once the route is found, click on the [[3D Map Button|Using the 3D Map]] and see the route in full super 3D!
