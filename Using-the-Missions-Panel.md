The missions panel shows you your current mission state and past mission successes and failures.

It consists of two grids, separated by a splitter which you can set to any proportion between the two grids. The grids are:

* Top: Current missions (if any)

* Bottom: Previously completed, abandoneded or failed missions, or missions where the expiry time has passed.

The grids adapts to the currently selected travel history entry, so if you move the selected position up and down you can see the mission state at a certain point in time.

The grids show:
* The name of the mission
* The start and end (expiry) date
* The origin (system and station) of the mission
* The faction that gave you the mission. 
* The destimation (system and station) if applicable. For some missions, Frontier does not give this.
* The target faction you are attacking, if applicable.
* The Result (previous grid only) of the mission, either the moneytary reward, or Abandoned, Failed etc.
* Any other Information about the mission, such as what was being carried, any commodity rewards etc.

The grids are sortable, but always default to time order.

The previous grid has a time date start/end picker which allows you to limit the range of display.  And it also sums up the value and totals for completed/abandoned/failed missions.
