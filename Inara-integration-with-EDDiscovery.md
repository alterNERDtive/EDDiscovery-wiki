From EDD 10.1, EDD support integration with Inara.

Go to [[Inara|https://inara.cz/settings-api/]] and request an API key. 

Go to the settings panel, select the commander and hit Edit.  In the Inara section, set your Inara commander name (it may be different to your ED name, if not you can leave it blank) and the Inara API you obtained.

EDD will sent data to Inara to keep it up to date with your activities.  There is delay in sending the data to prevent flooding Inara, so it can take up to 1 minute for Inara to be updated.

If you want to send your historical fleet details to Inara you can do this via the Admin menu.
