In order to send journal history, ship details and trilateration results to EDSM, you need to have configured an API key.

You also need to first head over to [www.edsm.net](http://www.edsm.net) and create yourself a free account.  With that done, in EDSM go to the user drop down and select 'My API Key'

Now copy the numbers and and letters from the API Key

Go to the settings panel, select the commander and hit Edit.  In the EDSM section, set your EDSM commander name (it may be different to your ED name, if not you can leave it blank) and the EDSM API you obtained.

EDD will sent your journal entries to EDSM to keep it up to date with your travels.  It will send all your jump history (slowly) to give it historical jump data.
