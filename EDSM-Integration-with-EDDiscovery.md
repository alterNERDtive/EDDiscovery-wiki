In order to send journal history, ship details and trilateration results to EDSM, you need to have configured an API key.

You also need to first head over to [http://www.edsm.net/](www.edsm.net) and create yourself a free account.  With that done, in EDSM go to the user drop down and select 'My API Key'

And paste into the "EDSM api key" section of the Settings tab as shown above.

Thats it.
