In order to save journal history and trilateration results back into EDSM, you need to have configured an API key.  

First head over to [http://www.edsm.net/](www.edsm.net) and create yourself a free account.  With that done, in EDSM go to the user drop down and select 'My API Key'

And paste into the "EDSM api key" section of the Settings tab as shown above.

That's it!  You should now be able to submit your trilaterated distances back to EDSM as well and sync your travel logs back and forth.
